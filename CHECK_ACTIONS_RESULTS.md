# ✅ GitHub Actions Test Results

## Status: Push Successful!
**✅ Code pushed to GitHub successfully**

## Next Steps to Check Actions:

### 1. View GitHub Actions:
Go to: https://github.com/bardoun7894/qudrat100-wordpress/actions

### 2. What You Should See:
- **Workflow name:** "Deploy to Live Server"
- **Trigger:** Latest commit "Test: GitHub Actions workflow trigger"
- **Status:** Either running 🟡 or failed ❌ (expected to fail without FTP credentials)

### 3. Expected Failure:
The workflow should FAIL at the FTP step because we haven't added Hostinger credentials yet. This is normal and expected!

### 4. Error Message Should Say:
Something like: "Failed to connect to FTP server" or "Missing FTP credentials"

## If Actions Are Working:
✅ GitHub Actions workflow is configured correctly
✅ Triggers on push to master branch
✅ Ready to add FTP credentials for actual deployment

## If No Actions Appear:
- Check if workflows are in `.github/workflows/` folder
- Verify YAML syntax is correct
- Make sure repository has Actions enabled
