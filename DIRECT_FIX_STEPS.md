# 🚀 DIRECT FIX - Upload Theme Files via Hostinger File Manager

## 🎯 The Issue
Your live WordPress site is missing the proper theme files. The theme folder exists but doesn't have all the correct content from localhost.

## ✅ Solution: Upload Complete Theme via File Manager

### Step 1: Go to Hostinger File Manager
1. Login to **Hostinger Control Panel**
2. Click **Files → File Manager**
3. Navigate to: `domains/qudrat100.com/public_html/wp-content/themes/`

### Step 2: Backup & Delete Old Theme
1. Right-click on `custom-theme` folder
2. Select **Compress** (creates custom-theme.zip backup)
3. After compression completes, **Delete** the `custom-theme` folder

### Step 3: Upload New Theme
1. Click **Upload** button (top right)
2. Select file: `C:\Users\Chairi\wordpress\custom-theme-COMPLETE.zip`
3. Wait for upload to complete (should be ~40KB)
4. Right-click the uploaded ZIP file
5. Select **Extract**
6. Extract to current location
7. Delete the ZIP file after extraction

### Step 4: Verify Files Are Uploaded
Check that `custom-theme` folder now contains:
- ✅ `front-page.php` (15 KB)
- ✅ `functions.php` (9 KB)
- ✅ `header.php` (5 KB)
- ✅ `footer.php` (2 KB)
- ✅ `style.css` (24 KB)
- ✅ `index.php`
- ✅ `page.php`
- ✅ `single.php`
- ✅ `page-landing.php`
- ✅ `images/` folder
- ✅ `js/` folder

### Step 5: Activate Theme via SSH
Open Command Prompt and run:
```bash
ssh.bat
```

Then execute:
```bash
cd domains/qudrat100.com/public_html
wp theme activate custom-theme --allow-root
wp cache flush --allow-root
wp transient delete --all --allow-root
exit
```

### Step 6: Clear Browser Cache & Test
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete** (clear browser cache)
2. Visit: https://qudrat100.com
3. Should now match localhost:8080 exactly!

## 🔧 Alternative: Upload Individual Files

If ZIP upload doesn't work, upload these files one by one:

### Critical Files to Upload:
1. **functions.php** - Loads CSS and theme functionality
   - Upload to: `wp-content/themes/custom-theme/functions.php`

2. **front-page.php** - Homepage template
   - Upload to: `wp-content/themes/custom-theme/front-page.php`

3. **header.php** - Header template
   - Upload to: `wp-content/themes/custom-theme/header.php`

4. **footer.php** - Footer template
   - Upload to: `wp-content/themes/custom-theme/footer.php`

5. **style.css** - Theme stylesheet
   - Upload to: `wp-content/themes/custom-theme/style.css`
