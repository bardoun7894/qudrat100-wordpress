<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">
```

### 2. Logo Image Not Loading

```

**Fixed to absolute path:**

<img src="/assets/images/iconword.png">
```

## 🚀 Upload Instructions

### Step 1: Remove Old Files (If Already Uploaded)
1. Login to Hostinger File Manager
2. Delete the old files:
   - Delete `includes/` folder from public_html
   - Delete theme folder from `wp-content/themes/custom-theme/`

### Step 2: Upload Fixed ZIP
1. **Upload:** `qudrat100-upload-FIXED.zip` to `public_html`
2. **Extract:** Right-click → Extract
3. **Move theme:** Move extracted `wp-content/themes/custom-theme` to existing `wp-content/themes/`

### Step 3: Update Database Connection
Edit `includes/db_connection.php`:
```php
define('DB_NAME', 'u336527051_PpH8D');
define('DB_USER', 'u336527051_oLmgA');
define('DB_PASSWORD', '5r8PofeOK9');
define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
```

### Step 4: Test Site

## 🔄 What Changed

### Files Updated:
1. **`includes/header.php`**
   - Fixed CSS path: `/assets/css/style.css`
   - Fixed logo path: `/assets/images/iconword.png`

2. **`wp-content/themes/custom-theme/front-page.php`**
   - Fixed brochure image name

### Why This Fixes It:
- **Absolute paths** (`/assets/`) work from any location
- **Relative paths** (`assets/`) only work from root directory
- Your standalone files (demo.php, quiz.php) are in root
- WordPress theme files are in subdirectories
