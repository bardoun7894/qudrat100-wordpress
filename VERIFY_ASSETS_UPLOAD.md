# 🔍 Verify Assets Folder on Server

## 🎯 The Real Issue Might Be

**The `assets` folder might not be uploaded to the server!**

This would explain why:
- ✅ demo.php works (has inline CSS backup)
- ✅ quiz.php works (has inline CSS backup)
- ❌ WordPress homepage doesn't work (relies on external CSS file)

---

## ✅ Quick Verification via SSH

```bash
ssh -p 65002 u336527051@82.29.185.27

# Check if assets folder exists
ls -la ~/public_html/ | grep assets

# Check if CSS file exists
ls -la ~/public_html/assets/css/style.css

# Test CSS URL
curl -I https://qudrat100.com/assets/css/style.css
```

**If you see "No such file or directory" - THAT'S THE PROBLEM!**

## 🚀 Upload Assets Folder via SSH/SCP

### From your Windows computer:

```bash
# Upload entire assets folder
scp -P 65002 -r "C:\Users\Chairi\wordpress\assets" u336527051@82.29.185.27:~/public_html/

# Upload just the CSS file (faster)
scp -P 65002 "C:\Users\Chairi\wordpress\assets\css\style.css" u336527051@82.29.185.27:~/public_html/assets/css/
```

### Or via Hostinger File Manager:
1. Go to Files → File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html`
3. Click Upload
4. Upload the entire **assets** folder from:
   `C:\Users\Chairi\wordpress\assets\`

## 📂 What Should Be on Server

```
~/public_html/
├── assets/              ⬅️ THIS MUST EXIST!
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css   ⬅️ THIS FILE IS CRITICAL!
│   └── images/
│       ├── iconword.png
│       └── بروشور-دورة-القدرة-المعرفية-ج47.jpg
```

---

## 🔍 Test After Upload

```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -lh ~/public_html/assets/css/style.css

# Test URL
curl https://qudrat100.com/assets/css/style.css | head -20

# Should show CSS content, not 404 error
```

## 🎯 Why This Fixes Everything

**WordPress theme's functions.php loads:**
```php
wp_enqueue_style('main-assets-css', site_url('/assets/css/style.css'), array(), '2.0');
```

**This creates URL:** `https://qudrat100.com/assets/css/style.css`

**If file doesn't exist:** WordPress can't load CSS → Homepage looks broken

**If file exists:** WordPress loads same CSS as demo.php → Homepage looks perfect!

**First, verify if assets folder exists on server! That's likely the missing piece! 🎯**
